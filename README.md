# SNHU-CS-340-Client-Server-Development

-How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Creating reusable and adaptable programs creates longevity to your work and gives you the ability to create something that is long lasting. With this mindset when building, you can always grow with scalability and accomdate to changes as needs or updates continue to develop. It promotes things like cost effectiveness, consistency, and even collaborate with others well who may be new to the project.

-How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I try to devour things in chunks and after that break it further down into minimal steps so nothing is overlooked and it can become overwhelming when trying to look at it in a bigger picture. Doing this method and taking it step by step can be beneficial in any situation faced, especially in the development phase.

-What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Every application you use, every platform you use to watch tv, the smart appliances you use, majority of things in our day to day that require behind the scene development that make things easier for us, are produced by computer scientists. This can be a major position when working with any company, in any industry and there is always someone or need to make things easier for us especially with the trend of how we are technically advancing.

About the Project/Project Title
I work for Global Rain, and our current project involves assisting Grazioso Salvare, an international pet rescue and training company with five animal shelters across Texas. Grazioso Salvare needed a database to identify suitable pets from their shelters for various training programs.
●	An explanation of the purpose of the CRUD Python module
This project dives deeper into the understanding of CRUD which is the create, read, update and delete function that will assist Grazioso Salvare to execute the needs they require to assist them in searching their database. 
Motivation
We recommend using MongoDB for this project due to its robust file communication capabilities and NoSQL features. Using the CRUDfunctions is straightforward and using MongoDB, will align with our goals of enhancing project satisfaction, facilitating client interactions, promoting reusability, and ensuring ease of access.

Installation and Reproducing
The development and testing process was all done within the SNHU virtual lab environment, where our class used the Linux operating system in partnership with the Apporto server system. The MongoDB database operated on a Linux platform, where both the Linux and MongoShell were configured to serve distinct purposes. The .csv file was meant to be imported into the MongoDB database, while a user profile with administrative privileges was created. Then, a Python script was developed, using the power of the pymongo library to establish a connection to the MongoDB AAC database using the credentials of the user to become accessible. The Python code also featured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions designed to change the database as needed with specific requirements when called upon. 
Usage
●	A description of the Python driver for Mongo that was used and why it was chosen: 
Choosing to utilize the Python driver for MongoDB is the fact that there is much reliability and capabilities when working with MongoDB. The Python driver seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, providing a convenient and efficient means of interacting with the database.
●	An explanation of the attributes and working functionality of the CRUD operations:
Create or “C” can help with adding new documents into a collection. This will add new data or information into a database, like a new animal. Read or “R” will retrieve data from the database you need and “read” specific documents that meet certain criteria. Update or “U” will allow changes to be made to the data in the database. We can update one or more fields within a document or replace the entire document if needed. Finally, there is Delete or “D” , this will remove documents or data from the database. This can allow managing data and removing anything that may not be relevant or outdated.

Roadmap/Features (Optional)
It would possibly be helpful to create offline accessibility to access the database so that workers who need to access who are on the field can be helpful to Grazioso Salvare or even visual application features too like a map to locate the nearby shelters or pinpointing strays found and transported to.
Further improvement could include data validation and further security when considering the validity of the user.
